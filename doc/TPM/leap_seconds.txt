Whenever a leap second is added to the civil calendar, 
the file src/tpm/delta_AT.c must be updated to reflect the new 
accumulated number of leap seconds for subsequent dates.

You can compute the MJD test value that should be added to the code
using pytpm as follows:

Let y,m and d be the first date to which the leap second applies.

import pytpm.tpm as tpm
x = tpm.gcal2j(y,m,d) - tpm.MJD_0

x is the MJD test value.

Add a line at the end of the delta_AT.c file, before return(dt);

if (utc >= x) dt=<NEW_VALUE>;

where <NEW_VALUE> is the accumulated number of leap seconds for dates
after this mjd.
