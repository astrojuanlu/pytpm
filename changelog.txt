------------

+ utils.convert now accepts delta UT value and polar motion
  components. 

  ``delta_ut`` is set with value corresponding to time in timetag.

+ Added more documentation.

+ A few more tests

  - utils.convert function tested with SIMBAD
    values. Agrees to 3 decimal places in decimal degrees.
  - Tests for matrix and vector functions.
